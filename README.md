# 🧪 The Frankenstack Sampler

A web app, designed to sample an ever-growing kitchen sink of popular tech (cloud services, languages, frameworks, libraries,  ...) for my curiosity and exploration.

## Purpose

- To touch and explore a wide range of technologies.

- To experience how each piece works at a very basic level.

- To meet the challenge of wiring them all together in a working system.

## How to build and run

```bash
docker compose up
```
